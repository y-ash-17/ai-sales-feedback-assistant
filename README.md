🤖 AI Sales Call Coach
This project is an AI-powered Streamlit web application that analyzes sales call transcripts. It uses a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the call outcome (success/failure) and customer satisfaction (Positive/Non-Positive).
The models' predictions and key call metrics are then fed to a local LLM (Ollama/Mistral) to generate dynamic, actionable feedback for the sales representative.

🚀 The Solution: A "Hybrid" AI Model
This project proves that a "hybrid" model is highly effective. Instead of relying only on complex deep learning, we combine two types of features:
"Expert" Custom Features: 4 hand-engineered features that capture the structure of the call (e.g., salesman_talk_ratio, turn_count).
"Meaning" Features (Embeddings): The 384-dimensional text embeddings from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 are compressed using PCA to a 30-feature "signal vector" that represents the meaning of the conversation.

These 34 features are then fed into two separate "specialist" models:
Outcome Model: A RandomForestClassifier (73% accuracy) that predicts success or failure.
Satisfaction Model: A RandomForestClassifier (70% accuracy) that predicts Positive or Non-Positive sentiment.
The final feedback is generated by sending these predictions and features to a Mistral LLM running via Ollama.
Feature Importance
The "expert" features were consistently ranked as the most important predictors, proving the success of this hybrid approach.
